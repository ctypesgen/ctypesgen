ctypesgen-json parses C header files and outputs JSON intended to be
used for generating libffi bindings. In particular, it is intended to
be used with Mork, which generates bindings for Lua, using the
alien module (which binds libffi to Lua). ctypesgen-json is
distributed under the New (2-clause) BSD License:

ctypesgen-json is a fork of ctypesgen, the pure-Python wrapper
generator: http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen/

libffi is a portable Foreign Function Interface library:

Mork, the friendly alien, can be found at:

Usage
-----

By default, ctypesgen-json works exactly like ctypesgen, for backwards
compatibility with ctypesgen. To get JSON output, use
--output-language=json. You will probably want to use --all-headers
--builtin-symbols --no-stddef-types --no-gnu-types --no-python-types
too.
