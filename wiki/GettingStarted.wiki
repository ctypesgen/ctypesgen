# What you need to know to get started with ctypesgen

= Requirements =

Only 2 requirements:

  * Python, at least [http://groups.google.com/group/ctypesgen/browse_thread/thread/983b59d856e963a6 version 2.4]
  * A C pre-compiler, if you have a C compiler installed such as GCC you already have one


= Windows =

Windows does not ship a compiler/pre-processor with the operating system so one needs to be installed. For example, http://www.mingw.org

Assuming mingw32 has been installed in the default location, open a command prompt and issue:

{{{
path %SystemDrive%\MinGW\bin;%PATH%
ctypesgen.py -l MYLIB - o pyMYLIB.py MYLIB.h
}}}

Where MYLIB.dll is the name of the name of the dll of interest and MYLIB.h is the main header include file.


Alternatively gcc does not need to be in the path:

{{{
ctypesgen.py --cpp="%SystemDrive%\MinGW\bin\gcc.exe -E" -l MYLIB - o pyMYLIB.py MYLIB.h
}}}

The --cpp flag could also be used to call the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler cl.exe.
